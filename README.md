### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am [Constantinos Charalambous](https://github.com/halfgoku)

I am Senior Software Engineer currently working at multi-billion dollar revenue company. 

Due to work I did not have a lot of time to work on projects on git or even upload anything but as all developers usualy do, I was working on personal projects and ideas that I had.
I never uploaded anything on git but lately I feel like I can offer some of my proffesional experience in the community through some of my projects.

Do check out my repositories and feel free to reach out if you would like to work on any of my existing projects.

My primary language focus is on Microsoft CSharp
